Creates burger names using a textbox and pushes it to the SQL server, then appends it to the 'burgers available' section using handlebars. From there the option to "eat" the burger (Change it's devoured state from false to true in the database) which will cause it to appear in the 'devoured' section with the option to "digest" (delete) that burger name.
